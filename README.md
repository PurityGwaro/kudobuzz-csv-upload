Created an API to:

- control the upload of csv files, 
- connection to the database, 
- extracting of data from database to pass to UI,
- parsing of csv files,
- pagination,
- prevent duplication,

Created a frontend UI to:

- allow client upload csv file,
- display uploaded files in tabular form,
- display customer details in tabular form

What I should have done better:

- added testing,
- structure the code better to make it readable,
- styled the UI more to make it more appealing

Technologies used:
- frontend - reactjs
- backend - node
- database - mongodb

Instructions to start the app:
- cd backend - npm start
- cd frontend - npm start
